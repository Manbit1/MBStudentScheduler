# Manbit Student's scheduler. An open source scheduler app for student's and my first project on android
This open source, completely ad-less app allows you to input your classes, their rooms, and their start times and it will notify before the class starts by a user specified time 

## Features
- completely free and ad-less
- Allows you to make some classes send an alarm instead of a simple notification (WiP)
- There's a notes tab if you want to type some important stuff that you need to do like quiz times or deadlines or maybe just comment on how shiny your proffesor's head is
